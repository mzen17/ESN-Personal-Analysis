In this context, "landscape" refers to the **overall appearance of an area, including its natural features like landforms and vegetation, as well as man-made elements like buildings, roads, and pathways.**

The images show a variety of scenes that fit this definition:

*   **Natural elements:** Rivers, lakes, trees, grass, and sky are prominent in many of the images.
*   **Man-made elements:** Buildings (university buildings, in particular), roads, pathways, streetlights, and fences are also visible.
*   **The combination:** The images depict how these natural and man-made features interact to create a specific environment or scene. For example, one image shows a paved path running alongside a grassy area and a body of water, while another shows a road passing by university buildings.

Essentially, "landscape" in this context encompasses the **visible environment and its characteristics.**
