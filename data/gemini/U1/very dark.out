The images I associate with "very dark" evoke a sense of **nighttime, dim lighting, and potential mystery or quietude.** Here's a breakdown of what I observe and infer:

**Visual Elements:**

*   **Low Light Levels:** The most obvious characteristic is the lack of bright, direct sunlight. The dominant colors are blues, grays, and blacks, with limited areas of illumination.
*   **Artificial Lighting:** Artificial light sources are prominent. These include:
    *   **Streetlights:** Providing pools of light along pathways and roads.
    *   **Building Lights:** Illuminating windows, creating a sense of activity or occupancy within structures.
    *   **Decorative Lighting:** String lights and colorful LEDs wrapped around trees and buildings, suggesting festive or atmospheric embellishments.
    *   **Reflections:** The water in the first image beautifully reflects the bridge lights, adding another layer of visual depth and contributing to the overall dimness.
*   **Silhouettes and Shadows:** Many objects and structures are rendered as silhouettes against the slightly illuminated sky or ground. Deep shadows obscure details, creating a sense of the unknown.
*   **Clear Sky vs. Cloudy Sky:** While some images show a clear, deep blue twilight sky, others hint at a darker, perhaps cloudier night sky, further emphasizing the darkness.
*   **Limited Detail:** The lack of light means that finer details are often lost. Textures, subtle colors, and facial features (if people were present) would be difficult to discern.

**Inferred Associations and Moods:**

*   **Nighttime Activities:** The presence of streetlights and illuminated buildings suggests that these scenes depict urban or suburban environments at night. This could be a time for:
    *   **Quiet Reflection:** The stillness and reduced visual input can invite introspection.
    *   **Evening Strolls or Commutes:** People might be walking or driving, navigating the darkened landscape.
    *   **Social Gatherings:** Restaurants and shops with interior lights on suggest continued operation and social interaction.
*   **Atmosphere and Ambiance:**
    *   **Serenity/Peace:** The absence of daylight can create a calming and peaceful atmosphere.
    *   **Mystery/Intrigue:** The obscured details and shadows can spark curiosity and a sense of wonder about what lies beyond the illuminated areas.
    *   **Romance:** Certain lighting arrangements, like string lights, can contribute to a romantic or intimate mood.
    *   **Festivity:** The colorful decorative lights in some images clearly indicate a celebratory or holiday-themed setting.
*   **The Contrast Between Light and Dark:** The effectiveness of the "very dark" is amplified by the presence of light sources. These points of light become focal points, guiding the viewer's eye and highlighting the surrounding darkness.
*   **A Sense of Emptiness or Quietude:** While some images show signs of life (cars, people, illuminated buildings), the overall darkness can also suggest a quietness, a reduction in the usual hustle and bustle of daylight.

In summary, "very dark" as depicted in these images is not necessarily an absence of all light, but rather a state where natural light is minimal, and artificial illumination becomes the primary means of perception. This creates a distinct atmosphere, often associated with the quiet, introspective, or mysterious qualities of nighttime.
