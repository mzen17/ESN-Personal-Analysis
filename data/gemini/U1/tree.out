In this context, "tree" refers to a **woody perennial plant, typically having a single stem or trunk growing to a considerable height and bearing lateral branches at some distance from the ground.**

The images show trees in various settings:

*   **Image 1:** A street scene with landscaping, featuring a prominent green tree with a developed canopy.
*   **Image 2:** A nighttime street view of a town, with trees lining the sidewalk, some appearing to be bare or with minimal foliage.
*   **Image 3:** An urban plaza at dusk, with trees that are either bare or have sparse branches, some decorated with string lights.
*   **Image 4:** A nighttime street scene with a bare-branched tree on the sidewalk.
*   **Image 5:** A nighttime street view with bare-branched trees decorated with string lights, likely for a festive occasion.

The common element across these images is the presence of these plants, characterized by their branching structures and woody stems, whether they have leaves or are in a dormant state.
