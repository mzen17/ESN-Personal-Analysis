The images I associate with "very dark" are the first two. Here's a detailed breakdown of what I think is associated with them:

**Characteristics of "Very Dark" in these images:**

*   **Absence of Bright Natural Light:** The most prominent feature is the lack of direct sunlight. The sky in the first image is a deep, inky blue, suggesting twilight or very early morning. The second image also shows a dark sky with minimal ambient light.
*   **Dominance of Artificial Light Sources:** In both images, the only significant illumination comes from artificial sources.
    *   **Streetlights:** These are clearly visible and cast pools of light, but also contribute to the overall darkness by highlighting their immediate surroundings.
    *   **Building Lights:** Windows of buildings are illuminated, indicating occupancy or internal lighting.
    *   **Decorative Lighting:** The string lights in the first image are a good example of artificial light used for aesthetic purposes, but their light is relatively dim compared to the surrounding darkness.
*   **Deep Shadows and Low Contrast:** Areas not directly illuminated are very dark, creating a sense of depth and mystery. The contrast between the lit areas and the shadowed areas is high. This makes it difficult to discern details in the unlit portions.
*   **Limited Visibility of Textures and Colors:** The muted light makes it harder to perceive the fine textures of surfaces (like bricks or pavement) and the nuances of colors. Colors tend to appear desaturated or dominated by the color of the light source (e.g., the blue tones in the first image).
*   **Atmosphere and Mood:** The "very dark" quality evokes a sense of:
    *   **Quietude and Serenity:** The lack of bright daylight often signals a time of reduced activity, leading to a feeling of peace.
    *   **Intrigue and Mystery:** The obscured details can create a sense of the unknown or the unseen.
    *   **Coolness:** Darker environments often feel cooler, both visually and potentially temperature-wise.
    *   **Urban Setting:** Both images depict urban environments at night or during twilight, suggesting a transition between day and night in a populated area.
*   **Focus on Shapes and Silhouettes:** When details are obscured by darkness, the viewer's attention is drawn to the overall shapes and silhouettes of objects and structures.

**Contrast with the "Not Very Dark" Images:**

The other three images are clearly *not* "very dark." They exhibit:

*   **Abundant Natural Light:** The third image shows a clear sky with a warm hue near the horizon, indicating dawn or dusk with ambient light. The fourth and fifth images have bright, overcast or sunny skies respectively, with clear visibility of the landscape.
*   **Natural Colors and Textures:** The natural colors of the trees, water, and sky are vibrant and detailed. Textures are clearly visible on the ground, rocks, and vegetation.
*   **Higher Overall Brightness and Contrast:** While there are shadows in these images, they are not as deep or pervasive as in the "very dark" examples. The overall scene is much brighter.
*   **Different Moods:** These images evoke feelings of openness, nature, daytime activity, and clearer visibility.

In summary, "very dark" is primarily associated with a significant lack of natural light, reliance on artificial illumination, deep shadows, and a resulting atmosphere that can be serene, mysterious, or simply indicative of nighttime in an urban setting.
