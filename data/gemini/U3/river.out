Based on the images provided, the concept of 'river' is associated with a variety of elements, forming a cohesive natural and sometimes urban landscape. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**1. Water and its Properties:**

*   **Body of Water:** The most direct association is the large, flowing body of water itself. This is evident in images where the water is the central focus, reflecting the sky and surrounding environment.
*   **Reflection:** The glassy surface of the water often acts as a mirror, reflecting the trees, sky, clouds, and even man-made structures. This creates a sense of depth and visual symmetry.
*   **Movement (implied):** While not explicitly shown as rapid movement, the very nature of a river implies flow. The gentle ripples in some images suggest this subtle movement.

**2. Natural Surroundings:**

*   **Trees and Vegetation:** Rivers are typically bordered by lush vegetation. The images show dense trees, bushes, and grasses along the riverbanks, creating a natural and often verdant setting. The presence of trees suggests a healthy ecosystem supported by the water.
*   **Greenery:** The dominant color in the natural areas surrounding the rivers is green, indicative of thriving plant life.
*   **Shoreline:** The edges of the river are shown with varying textures, from grassy slopes to rocky embankments. This highlights the transition zone between water and land.
*   **Sky and Clouds:** The sky, often clear blue or dotted with clouds, is a constant presence, interacting with the water through reflection. This emphasizes the open-air, natural environment.

**3. Human Interaction and Infrastructure:**

*   **Pathways and Trails:** Several images feature paved paths or trails running alongside the river. This suggests that rivers are often destinations for recreation, walking, cycling, or jogging.
*   **Bridges and Overlooks:** The presence of railings and elevated walkways (like in the second and fourth images) indicates structures built to allow people to observe or cross the river. These are often designed to complement the natural beauty.
*   **Roads and Transportation:** In some images, roads are visible alongside the river, hinting at its integration into transportation networks or its proximity to urban areas. Cars are visible in the fourth image.
*   **Buildings (distant):** In a few instances, buildings are visible in the background, suggesting that rivers can flow through or near populated areas, creating a blend of natural and urban environments. The "INDQUIST CENTER" sign in the fifth image, while not directly on a riverbank, is in a park-like setting that could be near one.
*   **Lighting:** The night scene (seventh image) shows that rivers can also be appreciated in illuminated park settings, with streetlights casting a glow.

**4. Atmosphere and Mood:**

*   **Tranquility and Serenity:** The overall impression from these images is one of peace and calmness. The stillness of the water, the natural scenery, and the gentle light create a serene atmosphere.
*   **Nature's Beauty:** The images showcase the aesthetic appeal of a river environment, with its interplay of light, water, and greenery.
*   **Recreation and Leisure:** The presence of paths and the general ambiance suggest that rivers are valued for leisure activities and connecting with nature.

**In summary, 'river' evokes a multifaceted image encompassing:**

*   **The physical presence of flowing water.**
*   **A rich natural environment with abundant plant life.**
*   **Human-made elements that facilitate access and enjoyment of the river.**
*   **A sense of peace, beauty, and a connection to nature.**

The images demonstrate that a river is not just a body of water, but a vibrant ecosystem and a significant element of the landscape that supports both natural beauty and human activity.
