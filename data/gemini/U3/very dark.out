The images I associate with "very dark" primarily depict nighttime scenes where artificial lighting is a significant element. Here's a detailed breakdown of what I think is associated with "very dark" based on these images:

**1. Time of Day:**
*   **Night:** This is the most obvious association. The absence of natural daylight is the fundamental reason for the darkness. The sky in both images is black, confirming that it is nighttime.

**2. Lighting Conditions:**
*   **Low Ambient Light:** While it's dark, it's not completely pitch black. There's a noticeable lack of natural light, meaning any visible elements rely on artificial sources.
*   **Artificial Illumination as a Key Feature:** In "very dark" scenes like these, artificial lights become prominent. They define shapes, create mood, and make the environment navigable. The lights are not just functional but also decorative, as seen with the string lights and the colorful lights wrapped around the trees.
*   **Contrast:** The darkness creates a strong contrast between illuminated areas and shadowed areas. This contrast can be dramatic, emphasizing the forms of buildings, trees, and objects.
*   **Specific Types of Artificial Lighting:**
    *   **Streetlights/Lamp Posts:** These provide general illumination for pathways and streets.
    *   **Building Lights:** Lights emanating from windows and storefronts contribute to the overall brightness and indicate activity within the structures.
    *   **Decorative Lighting:** String lights, colored lights on trees, and other festive illuminations add visual interest and break up the monotony of the darkness.

**3. Visual Elements and Their Perception:**
*   **Silhouettes:** Objects that are not directly lit often appear as dark silhouettes against brighter backgrounds. This can create a sense of mystery or give a simplified, graphic representation of forms.
*   **Limited Visibility:** The extent of what can be seen is significantly reduced. Details in the distance are often obscured.
*   **Emphasis on Color:** When colored lights are present, they can appear more vibrant and saturated against the dark backdrop. The neon-like colors of the lights in the second image are a good example of this.
*   **Shadows:** Large, deep shadows are a defining characteristic of "very dark" environments. These shadows contribute to the mood and can distort perceptions of depth and space.

**4. Atmosphere and Mood:**
*   **Quiet and Stillness:** Nighttime scenes often evoke a sense of quiet and stillness, especially when there are fewer people present.
*   **Mystery and Enigma:** The reduced visibility and the play of light and shadow can create an atmosphere of mystery or intrigue. What lies beyond the illuminated areas is unknown.
*   **Calmness or Serenity:** For some, nighttime can also be associated with calmness and a sense of peace, a time for rest.
*   **Vibrancy (Contradictory but Present):** Despite the darkness, the presence of colorful, active lighting can also inject a sense of vibrancy and life into the scene, suggesting that the area is still alive and active, even at night.

**5. Environmental Context:**
*   **Urban or Suburban Settings:** Both images appear to be taken in built-up environments, likely urban or suburban areas, where artificial lighting is commonplace.
*   **Sidewalks and Streets:** The presence of sidewalks, streetlights, and parked cars indicates public spaces.

In essence, "very dark" is a descriptor that acknowledges the absence of strong natural light and highlights the role of artificial illumination in shaping our perception of the environment. It's a state where shadows dominate, and the limited light sources become focal points, influencing both what we see and how we feel about the scene.
