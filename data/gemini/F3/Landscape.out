Based on the images provided, "Landscape" in this context refers to **natural or semi-natural outdoor scenery**.

Here's why:

*   **Presence of natural elements:** All the images feature water (rivers, lakes), trees, grass, and sky. These are fundamental components of natural landscapes.
*   **Open spaces:** The images show expanses of land and water, not confined indoor environments.
*   **Absence of urban clutter:** While some images show man-made structures like bridges, buildings, and roads, these are integrated into the natural setting rather than dominating it. They appear to be part of a park, trail system, or waterfront area, suggesting a focus on the broader environment.
*   **Variety in time and weather:** The images show different times of day (daylight, dusk) and weather conditions (clear skies, cloudy skies), which are all aspects of how a landscape can be perceived.

Essentially, "Landscape" here encompasses the **visual appearance of an area of land, including its natural features and how they are arranged, often with a focus on scenic beauty or environmental characteristics.**
