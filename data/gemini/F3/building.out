Based on the images, "building" in this context refers to **structures that house educational institutions, particularly universities or colleges.**

Here's why:

*   **Image 1:** Shows a modern building with architectural elements, a paved plaza, trees, and benches, suggestive of a campus environment. There's also a sign that says "Welcome to Campus," reinforcing this idea.
*   **Image 2:** Clearly displays the words "COLLEGE OF LAW" above the entrance to a prominent structure. This directly points to an academic building.
*   **Image 3:** Features a large, modern multi-story building and other more traditional brick structures, along with manicured lawns and pathways, all characteristic of a university campus.

Therefore, the images collectively depict various **university buildings** that are part of an academic setting.
