Based on the images provided, the context of "city" appears to refer to an **urban downtown area or a commercial district**. Here's why:

*   **Presence of Businesses:** The images show storefronts with signage for restaurants, shops (e.g., "Sports Collectibles," "Tobacco Pipes," "Gym"), and what looks like a bakery.
*   **Streetscape Elements:** There are sidewalks, streetlights, benches, planters with trees and flowers, and street signs, all characteristic of a developed urban environment.
*   **Vehicles and Pedestrians:** Cars are parked on the street and driving, and there are people walking, indicating a populated area.
*   **Architectural Styles:** The buildings exhibit a mix of older brick structures and modern multi-story buildings, which is common in city centers.
*   **Evening/Nighttime Scenes:** Several images are taken at night, highlighting street lighting and decorative lights, often used to create ambiance in commercial areas.
*   **Maps and Information Boards:** One image shows a map of "Downtown Iowa City," directly reinforcing the idea of a central business district.

In summary, "city" in this context is not just a general term for a large settlement, but specifically refers to the **active, commercial heart of a town or city**, where people live, work, shop, and dine.
