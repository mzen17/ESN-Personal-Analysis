The images strongly associate with the concept of a **river**. Here's a detailed breakdown of what's associated:

**Direct Visual Elements of a River:**

*   **Water Body:** The most obvious association is the large, flowing body of water itself. In both images, the water is a prominent feature, reflecting the sky and surrounding landscape.
*   **Banks/Shorelines:** The edges of the water bodies are clearly depicted, showing variations in their composition.
    *   In the first image, one bank appears reinforced with rocks and gravel, suggesting potential erosion control or infrastructure. The other bank is more natural with trees and grass.
    *   In the second image, the banks are densely vegetated with trees and greenery, presenting a more natural, wilder feel.
*   **Flowing Motion (Implied):** While static images, the very nature of a river implies movement. The smooth surface of the water in the first image, and the slight ripples in the second, hint at this continuous flow.
*   **Reflections:** The water acts as a mirror, reflecting the sky, clouds, trees, and even man-made structures. This is a common visual characteristic of water bodies.

**Associated Natural Elements:**

*   **Vegetation:** Trees and various forms of plant life are consistently present along the riverbanks. This suggests that rivers are often found in areas with natural growth and ecosystems. The variety in foliage (some trees with red leaves in the first image) might suggest different seasons.
*   **Sky and Clouds:** The sky, with its clouds, is a significant element in both images, indicating an outdoor, natural setting. The dynamic nature of the clouds can also be associated with the open expanse often found around rivers.
*   **Wildlife (Implied):** While not directly visible, rivers are vital habitats for a wide array of wildlife, including fish, birds, and aquatic mammals. The presence of lush vegetation strongly hints at a supporting ecosystem.

**Associated Man-Made Elements:**

*   **Bridges:** The first image shows a road with vehicles, suggesting a bridge or overpass crossing the river, a very common infrastructure element associated with rivers to facilitate transportation. The second image also shows what appears to be a bridge structure in the distance.
*   **Roads and Infrastructure:** The presence of a road, railings (in the foreground of both images), and potentially buildings in the background (second image) indicates that rivers are often integrated into human settlements and transportation networks. The rocky embankment in the first image is also a clear example of human intervention.
*   **Vehicles:** Cars and potentially a bus in the first image further confirm the presence of human activity and transportation routes near the river.

**Associated Concepts and Feelings:**

*   **Nature and Serenity:** Rivers often evoke a sense of peace, tranquility, and the beauty of the natural world, especially when surrounded by greenery.
*   **Journey and Flow:** The concept of a river as a continuous journey, from source to mouth, is inherent. This can translate to metaphors of life, time, and progress.
*   **Connection and Life:** Rivers are essential for life, providing water for drinking, irrigation, and supporting ecosystems. They are often seen as lifelines for communities.
*   **Recreation and Leisure:** People often associate rivers with activities like fishing, boating, swimming, and simply enjoying the scenery.
*   **Power and Force:** While these images don't depict a powerful torrent, rivers are also associated with natural force, erosion, and the shaping of landscapes.
*   **Boundaries and Connections:** Rivers can act as natural boundaries between regions but also as conduits for trade and interaction.

In summary, the images vividly portray a river as a dynamic natural feature, intertwined with human infrastructure and often evoking feelings of nature, tranquility, and the flow of life.
