The images provided show various angles of a large complex of buildings, some of which are identified as the "Lindquist Center." Based on the architectural styles, the presence of walkways, landscaping, and the general urban setting, the term "building" in this context most likely refers to **a collection of structures that house academic institutions, research facilities, or administrative offices, possibly on a university campus.**

The "Lindquist Center" itself suggests a specific facility, and the surrounding structures appear to be part of a larger institutional or educational environment.
