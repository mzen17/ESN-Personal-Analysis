Based on the images provided, here's a detailed breakdown of what is associated with 'very dark':

**Overall Impression:**

The primary association with 'very dark' in these images is the **absence of significant natural light**, leading to a scene dominated by shadows, artificial illumination, and a general dimness. This contrasts sharply with images bathed in daylight.

**Specific Elements Associated with 'Very Dark':**

*   **Nighttime or Twilight:** The most obvious characteristic of the 'very dark' images is that they are taken when the sun has set or is significantly below the horizon. This is evident from the deep blues and purples in the sky and the general lack of ambient daylight.
*   **Artificial Lighting:** In the absence of natural light, artificial sources become prominent. This includes:
    *   **Streetlights:** These provide isolated pockets of illumination, often casting a warm or cool glow on the immediate surroundings.
    *   **Building Lights:** Lights emanating from within buildings are a significant source of light, creating illuminated rectangles and squares in the dark facades. These can vary in color and intensity.
    *   **Decorative Lights:** The first image specifically showcases colorful, festive lights wrapped around trees, creating a vibrant contrast against the darkness.
*   **Shadows and Contrast:** The low light levels create deep, elongated shadows. Areas not directly hit by light are rendered in shades of black and very dark gray, leading to high contrast between illuminated and shadowed areas. This can obscure details and create a sense of depth or mystery.
*   **Limited Visibility and Detail:** In the darkest parts of the images, details become indistinct or completely invisible. Textures are lost, and the environment can appear more abstract.
*   **Atmospheric Conditions:** The presence of rain or wet surfaces, as seen in the last image, can further enhance the feeling of darkness and reflection. The wet ground acts like a mirror, reflecting the limited light sources and creating a more dynamic, albeit still dark, visual experience.
*   **Sense of Quiet or Solitude:** While not explicitly shown in every dark image, the lack of activity often associated with daylight can contribute to a feeling of quietness or solitude. The lone figure in the first image, for example, is amplified by the surrounding darkness.
*   **Architectural Emphasis:** The darkness can sometimes highlight the architectural forms of buildings, as the illuminated windows and structural lines stand out against the dark backgrounds.
*   **Muted Colors (except for artificial lights):** Natural colors are largely suppressed in these dark scenes. The colors that do appear are often derived from artificial light sources.

**Contrast with Lighter Images:**

The 'very dark' images stand in stark contrast to the images taken in daylight. The daylight images are characterized by:

*   **Abundant Natural Light:** Clear blue skies, bright sunlight, and well-lit environments.
*   **Clear Visibility and Detail:** All elements of the scene are clearly visible, with well-defined shapes, textures, and colors.
*   **Vibrant Colors:** Natural colors of foliage, buildings, and clothing are rendered vividly.
*   **Sense of Activity and Openness:** The presence of people and the overall brightness suggest a more active and open environment.

In essence, 'very dark' in these images signifies the absence of the sun's illuminating power, a condition where artificial lights take center stage, and the world is painted with shades of shadow and limited, often colorful, man-made illumination.
