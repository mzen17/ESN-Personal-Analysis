In both images, the word "tree" refers to the **woody perennial plants** that are characteristic of natural landscapes.

Here's a breakdown of what the images suggest about the context of "tree":

*   **Image 1:** This image shows a natural scene with a body of water and a dense line of trees along the bank. The trees are depicted as green and lush, suggesting a healthy forest or wooded area. They are a prominent feature of the landscape, contributing to the natural beauty of the scene.

*   **Image 2:** This image shows an urban or suburban environment with trees lining a sidewalk and surrounding buildings. The trees have autumn foliage, indicating seasonal changes. They are integrated into the urban landscape, providing shade, aesthetic appeal, and a connection to nature within a built environment.

In both cases, the **visual evidence strongly points to the literal, botanical meaning of trees** – living organisms with trunks, branches, and leaves.
