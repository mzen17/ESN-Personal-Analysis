Based on the provided images, here's what I associate with the concept of a 'river':

**Water Bodies and Flow:**
*   **Large bodies of water:** The most obvious association is the presence of a significant amount of water. This isn't a small stream, but a substantial waterway.
*   **Reflections:** The water in the images clearly reflects the sky, trees, and structures along its banks, indicating a smooth or calm surface.
*   **Movement (implied):** While not explicitly shown in motion, the very nature of a river implies a constant flow of water, even if it appears still in these snapshots.

**Natural Landscapes:**
*   **Trees and foliage:** Lush greenery lines the banks of the river in all the images, suggesting a natural or semi-natural environment.
*   **Banks and shorelines:** The edges of the water body are defined by natural terrain, often with grass, rocks, and vegetation.
*   **Sky and clouds:** The sky is a prominent feature, with clear blue skies in some and dramatic clouds in others, indicating open spaces and a connection to the atmosphere.

**Human Interaction and Infrastructure:**
*   **Bridges:** Multiple images feature bridges spanning the river, highlighting its role as a barrier that humans have overcome for transportation and connection.
*   **Pathways and walkways:** There are clear pathways or walkways along the riverbanks, suggesting recreational use and accessibility.
*   **Buildings and structures:** In some images, there are signs of human development, such as buildings and lighting, indicating that rivers often run through or near populated areas.
*   **Streetlights:** The presence of streetlights, especially in the twilight image, suggests urban or suburban development alongside the river.

**Atmosphere and Time of Day:**
*   **Twilight/Dawn:** One image captures the serene atmosphere of twilight or dawn, with a deep blue sky and the subtle colors of sunrise or sunset.
*   **Daylight:** Other images depict bright daylight with clear skies and warm sunlight, showcasing the vibrancy of the natural surroundings.

**Overall Impression:**
The images evoke a sense of **peace, natural beauty, and connectivity**. Rivers appear as vital arteries, supporting both natural ecosystems and human life. They are places for contemplation, recreation, and passage. The contrast between natural elements and human infrastructure suggests a harmonious coexistence, where the river acts as a central element around which life develops.
