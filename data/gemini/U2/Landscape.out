In the context of these images, "Landscape" refers to the **outdoor environment surrounding the Lindquist Center building**. It encompasses:

*   **Natural elements:** The grassy areas, reeds, shrubs, and trees are all part of the landscape.
*   **Man-made elements integrated with nature:** Pathways, railings, lighting, and the building itself are situated within and interact with the natural surroundings, forming a designed landscape.
*   **The overall outdoor scene:** It's the visual impression of the area outside the building, including its topography, vegetation, and built features.

Essentially, it's the **composition of the physical setting** that you see when you are outside the Lindquist Center.
