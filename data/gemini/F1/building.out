In the context of these images, "building" refers to **structures with walls and a roof, typically used for human habitation or other activities.**

The images showcase various types of buildings:

*   **In the first image:** You can see a multi-story commercial building with illuminated windows and signage for a restaurant and tobacco shop. In the background, there's a taller, modern building with many windows, suggesting it could be an apartment complex or office building.
*   **In the second image:** This image prominently features a large, modern residential or mixed-use building with multiple floors, balconies, and a glass facade. Adjacent to it is another building with a "GYM" sign, indicating a commercial space.

Both images depict constructed edifices that serve a purpose, be it commercial, residential, or recreational.
