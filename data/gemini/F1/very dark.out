The images I associate with "very dark" evoke a strong sense of **nighttime**, **absence of natural light**, and **limited illumination**. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

**Key Elements Associated with "Very Dark":**

*   **Absence of Sunlight/Daylight:** All the images clearly depict a scene after sunset. There's no hint of the sun's rays. The sky itself appears dark, ranging from a deep navy to an almost black hue, indicating the late hour.

*   **Artificial Lighting as the Dominant Source:** While the scenes are dark, they aren't entirely devoid of light. Instead, the light present is almost exclusively artificial. This includes:
    *   **Streetlights and Lampposts:** These cast pools of illumination, often creating distinct circles of light on the ground and highlighting immediate surroundings.
    *   **Building Lights:** Windows of buildings glow with interior lights, providing a sense of habitation or activity within structures that are otherwise shrouded in darkness.
    *   **Decorative Lighting:** The first image, in particular, features vibrant, colorful lights wrapped around trees, adding a festive or artistic element against the dark backdrop. This contrast emphasizes the darkness.
    *   **Subtle Ground Lighting:** In some images, small, low-lying lights (like those in the first image aimed at the ground) provide minimal illumination, creating soft glows on the surfaces they target.

*   **Shadows and Contrast:** The darkness inherently creates strong shadows. Objects and structures cast long, deep shadows, obscuring details and adding to the overall sense of depth and mystery. The interplay between illuminated areas and deep shadows is a defining characteristic.

*   **Limited Visibility and Scope:** The "very dark" environments restrict the field of vision. We can only clearly see what is directly lit. Areas further away or not in the direct path of light become indistinct, smudged shapes. This creates a feeling of enclosure or a limited known space.

*   **Atmosphere and Mood:** The darkness often carries an associated atmosphere. Depending on the context, it can evoke:
    *   **Serenity and Calm:** The quiet of the night, with its reduced activity, can be peaceful.
    *   **Mystery and Introspection:** The obscured views and reduced sensory input can lead to a more internal focus or a sense of the unknown.
    *   **Isolation or Solitude:** The emptiness of a darkened public space can suggest a lack of people, leading to feelings of being alone.
    *   **Potential for Danger (though not explicitly shown here):** In a broader context, darkness is often associated with reduced safety due to the inability to see potential threats. These images don't lean into this, but it's a common association.

*   **Textural Emphasis:** The limited light can sometimes highlight textures in a different way. For example, the wet surfaces in the third image reflect the artificial lights, creating shimmering patterns that stand out against the dark, wet ground.

In summary, "very dark" as depicted in these images is not simply the absence of light, but rather a state defined by the dominance of **artificial illumination against a pervasive natural darkness**, leading to a world of **contrasts, shadows, and limited visibility**, which in turn cultivates specific **atmospheres and moods**.
