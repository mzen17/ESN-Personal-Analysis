In this context, "Landscape" refers to the **visual appearance of an area of land and water**. It encompasses the natural features like trees, water bodies, and the sky, as well as any man-made structures like bridges and buildings that are part of the scene.

The images showcase different types of landscapes:

*   **Natural landscapes:** The second and fifth images focus on the natural beauty of a riverbank with trees and water.
*   **Urban or semi-urban landscapes:** The first and third images include bridges, buildings, and infrastructure alongside natural elements.
*   **Water features:** The presence of rivers and lakes is a prominent aspect in several of the images.
*   **Atmospheric conditions:** The time of day and weather (clear skies, dusk, overcast) also contribute to the overall "landscape."
