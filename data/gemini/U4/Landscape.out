In this context, "Landscape" likely refers to the **overall appearance and arrangement of the surrounding environment, including both natural and man-made elements.**

Here's why:

*   **Image 1:** Shows a view of buildings, a pathway, a bridge, and a street leading into the distance. This is an urban or campus landscape.
*   **Image 2:** Displays a building with the "Lindquist Center" sign, along with surrounding vegetation (grasses, bushes), trees, and a pathway. This is also a constructed environment with natural features.

Therefore, "Landscape" in these images encompasses:

*   **Architecture:** The buildings and their design.
*   **Infrastructure:** Pathways, bridges, streets, lighting.
*   **Vegetation:** Trees, grasses, bushes, and other plants.
*   **Topography:** The overall layout and contours of the land (though less prominent in these specific views).
*   **Atmosphere/Setting:** The general ambiance created by the combination of these elements, including the sky and light.

It's not just about the natural world, but how the natural world is integrated with or contrasted against the built environment.
