In the context of these images, "city" likely refers to a **urban or campus environment characterized by buildings, infrastructure, and public spaces.**

Here's why:

*   **Buildings:** Both images showcase various structures, from modern and angular to more traditional brick buildings. This is a hallmark of urban areas.
*   **Infrastructure:** The presence of walkways, railings, streetlights, and what appear to be roads or pathways suggests a developed area with infrastructure for people to move around.
*   **Public Spaces:** The open areas, pathways, and the general layout of the scenes imply designed spaces for public use or access, common in cities or institutional campuses.
*   **Sense of Scale:** The buildings and their arrangement suggest a degree of density and a built environment that extends beyond a single dwelling.

While not necessarily a bustling metropolis, these images depict a **structured, developed area with a concentration of buildings and public amenities, aligning with the general concept of a city.** It could be a downtown area, a university campus, or a planned community.
