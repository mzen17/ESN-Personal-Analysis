The images provided do not directly depict a river. However, based on the common associations with the word "river," here are some things that could be associated with a river, and how they might be hinted at or absent in these images:

**Common Associations with Rivers:**

*   **Water:** This is the most fundamental association. Rivers are bodies of flowing water. While not explicitly shown, the presence of a bridge in the first image suggests a waterway beneath it.
*   **Nature/Landscapes:** Rivers are often found in natural settings. This includes:
    *   **Greenery:** Trees, grass, plants, vegetation. The second image shows dry grasses and some bushes, which could be indicative of a natural area near a water source, though it appears more like landscaping.
    *   **Wildlife:** Fish, birds, aquatic animals. These are not visible in either image.
    *   **Erosion/Landforms:** Rivers shape the land around them, creating banks, valleys, and canyons. The slight texture on the bridge surface in the first image could *very loosely* be associated with wear and tear, perhaps from environmental factors, but it's a stretch.
*   **Movement/Flow:** The defining characteristic of a river is its continuous movement. This is inherently difficult to capture in a still image unless there are visual cues like ripples or a visible current.
*   **Bridges:** Bridges are built to cross rivers. The prominent bridge in the first image is a strong indicator that a river or similar waterway might be present.
*   **Transportation/Commerce:** Historically, rivers have been vital for transportation and trade. While not directly depicted, the presence of buildings in both images (especially the "Lindquist Center" in the second) might imply a community or institution that benefits from proximity to a river, either for logistics or aesthetics.
*   **Recreation:** Rivers are used for boating, fishing, swimming, and simply enjoying the scenery. Again, no direct evidence in the images, but a river would facilitate such activities.
*   **Sound:** The sound of flowing water is a common association. This is, of course, impossible to perceive from an image.
*   **Metaphorical Meanings:** Rivers can symbolize the passage of time, life's journey, or continuous change. These are abstract concepts not directly illustrated.

**How these associations might relate to the provided images:**

*   **Image 1 (Bridge and Buildings):** The most direct association here is the **bridge**, which strongly suggests the presence of a **river** or at least a significant body of water that needs to be crossed. The open sky and the perspective looking down a road lined with buildings hint at a developed area, possibly a campus or a city, where a river might be integrated into the urban landscape. The greenery on the sides of the path on the bridge could be **vegetation** found near water.
*   **Image 2 (Lindquist Center and Natural Area):** This image shows a modern building with landscaping. The dense, dry **grasses and bushes** in the foreground could be a form of **natural vegetation** that is often found near rivers. The overall feel is one of a more controlled, perhaps cultivated, natural space. The buildings in the background suggest a community, which, as mentioned, might be situated near a river.

In conclusion, while the images themselves don't show a river, the presence of a **bridge** in the first image is the most compelling indicator that a **river** is likely associated with the location depicted. The **vegetation** in both images, though different in style, also aligns with general associations of rivers being part of natural environments.
